## Project Summary

To build both the back-end and front-end of a music playlist creation and sharing platform web application.  This will require extensive coding, and configuring a working 
Express.js API using Sequelize to interact with a MySQl database. The application will use Express-session to maintain security through log-in functionality and a hash password.  

The functionality will include:
- Users log-in.
- Create playlists (Song Title-Artist-Genre).
- Ability to create/edit playlists.
- Ability to view other user playlists.
